# ConeDetection_FBDV
Matlab Code for cone detection for a formula student driverless car.

This is a matlab code which outputs a video with detected cones on both sides of a formula student driverless car. It will be used further with deployable GPU's to make it independently work from the live feed of the car through a camera.
